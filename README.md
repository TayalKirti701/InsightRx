# InsightRx : A Prescription for healthcare decisions

## Overview
This project utilizes synthetic Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data to derive actionable insights into patient care, hospital operations, and financial performance. The workflow involves data cleaning and transformation using MS SQL Server, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python and the development of interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize trends . 

The analysis focuses on key areas such as patient outcomes, cost management, readmission rates, and resource allocation, helping hospital administrators make informed, data-driven decisions. Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Readmission rates and high-risk patient groups

Departmental performance, patient satisfaction, and operational efficiency

Financial trends, revenue opportunities, and insurance coverage


## Data Structure Overview
To ensure compliance with HIPAA and avoid the use of real patient data, this project uses synthetic EMR records generated via Pythonâ€™s Faker library.

Key Data Fields:

Vital Signs: Blood pressure(Systolic/Diastolic) , heart rate, glucose levels

Diagnoses: ICD-10 codes

Procedures: CPT codes for surgeries

Patient Demographics: Age, gender, race

Insurance Coverage: Treatment costs, patient satisfaction scores

Readmission Info: Indicators of patient readmissions

This simulated dataset offers a secure, realistic platform for performing deep healthcare analytics without the risks of using real-world clinical data.
